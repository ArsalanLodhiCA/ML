0,M. D. HEALY,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7YKXY3LIQS2DRRGE6QSB3PSTUQ,YES,7,5,Superb book that covers practical issues that others don't,"Much of what is written about Machine Learning is focused on the algorithms, which are the ""cool"" part. But in practice, as with any large scale software project, most of your work will involve messier details like getting good training data, cleaning up issues with your training data, managing your data, solving problems that occur, etc., etc. And many ML systems are part of Enterprise Data Platforms, which means all the impedance mismatches between Agile thinking and continuous data curation need to be addressed.This book gets into all these practical details and how to handle them, with examples from actual experience. You cannot run a fancy hotel without dealing with plumbing problems; it's the same for ML in practice.",11/02/2022
1,Parimarjan Negi,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4S43FJVNA6K3C3KV2WWI6GNHXA,YES,7,5,Distills the best of the blogs and folk wisdom that ML engineers pick up over the years,"I am a PhD student, and have been working to apply ML to different domains for a few years. Recently, I started working with undergrad researchers who did not have any prior experience with ML applications, besides a class or so. But, there is a lot of knowledge that is just collected over the years while debugging problems, discussing with lab mates, or through the many blog posts online. These are the kind of issues that rarely come up in classes --- not just conceptual AI issues -- but how to deal with data / features / efficiently store things / logging etc. In the few chapters I have read through, I found this book to be like the collecting together and unifying the best blogposts and folk wisdom for practical, day to day ML issues. There were a whole lot of things that I did not know, or was curious about, but didn't know where to look for precise answers. But more than that, I found this book to be a perfect reference for the undergrad students I was mentoring -- I have lent my copy to a couple of students for reading particular chapters, particularly on training data and feature engineering, which quickly brings them up to speed on the best practices.",07/02/2022
2,Siamak S.,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGV3QWI7Q3HH4GZQACNIJDTTWJQ,YES,0,4,Practical book,"Practical content, well balanced between industry and academia. Covers wide variety of topics. Could use more depth in some sections. But overall very useful",08/14/2022
3,Z,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPV7ASC7NDU4EFEAG64M3RJGESQ,YES,3,5,Poor print quality,"This book is a fantastic read and covers systems design thinking and best practices behind machine learning rather than just tool-specific procedural knowledge. However, I was disappointed by the fact that it is in black and white print though, which ruins the graphics and makes it hard to read - there should be a clear label indicating it is in black and white, and it should not be full price when the publisher is cost-cutting by omitting the full color print.",08/09/2022
4,Denise Shekerjian,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRDK6LI2RSRLHZ2KQNNHZOPC2OQ,YES,6,5,This book delivers.,"Chip Huyen has a graceful way of deconstructing complicated things and explaining how the pieces combine to make a workable system that achieves a goal. Her book instills in her readers the kind of confidence that comes from a firm grasp of the facts. Sequential, logical, and clearly written with intelligible examples and flashes of humor, it’s a perfect delight to read. In short, Chip Huyen’s book delivers! A must read for the seasoned and novice alike!Denise Shekerjian, author of Uncommon Genius and other works",06/30/2022

6,Brad,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFYVJJPKAYXZS76C3K2PDK6MEUFQ,YES,3,5,A practical approach to ML,"My understanding of ML was limited to a course I took on it while studying at University. While I understood a lot of the theory, it is rare that you come away from such courses knowing what tools are being used in the industry to solve real problems. This book is an incredible resource for those looking to build upon their existing knowledge of ML and understand practical development techniques that are used in real world applications.",06/21/2022

17,GS,https://amazon.com ,YES,2,3, ,"this is an good book, but basically made by someone without any experience in delivering any production scale solution that are used to deliver actual sustained and increasing ROI on data investments.It takes at least a few decades of experience to deliver anything of value using data which does not invade people's privacy or try to change their behaviour or works on a business model that is not owing billions in fine to governments for destroying lives, markets, and free thinking.This book has promise and is not an outright fake, perhaps by the 6th or 7th edition of the book we will be able to see its contents mature to meaningful actionable items.But overall a good reading",12/04/2022

19,V Valton,https://amazon.com ,YES,0,5, ,"This book is absolutely brilliant and is a must read for anyone that worked in ML in academia and is moving to industry.I usually have to push myself to finish textbooks, but this is so nicely written that I kept reading with ease.This book is a masterpiece, and now my favourite ML book! It makes my top 5 ML recommendations along with: “Statistical rethinking”, “Machine learning a probabilistic perspective”, “Bayesian reasoning an machine learning” and “Dive into deep learning”My only negative is that the figures are printed in black and white, so I would have liked to have a pdf that came with the book to preview the figures in colour.",07/01/2022
20,Ammar Asmro,https://amazon.com ,YES,0,5, ,"This book represents the state of applied machine learning techniques at this time. It summarizes what took me tons of experiments to figure out, and things I haven't gotten the chance to work on or figure out yet. It touches on data formatting (input/output/...), feature engineering, model development and deployment, MLOps, and so much more. Having all these best practices to follow for every step in building an ML system is something I hoped to see in a resource. I put it on my top 3 list of ways to improve people's ML system design skills.",06/05/2022
